# True-Block-Weight-ARK-V3-Core

A robust and configurable True Block Weight (TBW) calculation and payment distribution system for ARK Core v3 and compatible blockchains.

## Overview

This tool allows delegates to automatically calculate and distribute rewards to voters based on their voting weight, with extensive configuration options for customization. **A key feature is support for multiple delegates within a single LXC server**, making it ideal for delegate teams or individuals managing multiple delegates.

## Key Features

- **Multi-delegate support**: Run and manage multiple delegates from a single installation
- Customizable voter reward sharing
- Flexible payment schedules
- Blacklist/whitelist functionality
- Optional cryptocurrency exchange integration
- Detailed logging for each delegate

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or higher
- pip (Python package manager)
- pm2 (Process manager for Node.js)

### Installing pm2

```bash
npm install pm2@latest -g
```

Or if you use Yarn:

```bash
yarn global add pm2
```

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up the True-Block-Weight system:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/stevendev0822/True-Block-Weight-ARK-V3-Core.git

# Navigate to the project directory
cd True-Block-Weight-ARK-V3-Core

# Create and activate a virtual environment
python -m venv .venv
.venv/scripts/activate  # On Windows
# source .venv/bin/activate  # On Linux/macOS

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Edit delegates.json with your configuration
```

## Multi-Delegate Setup

One of the most powerful features of this tool is the ability to manage multiple delegates from a single installation. This is especially useful for:

- Delegate teams sharing infrastructure
- Individual delegates running multiple delegates across different networks
- Backup delegates management

To configure multiple delegates:
1. Edit the `delegates.json` file to include configurations for each delegate
2. Each delegate can have its own unique sharing settings, payment schedules, and voter rules
3. Run commands with the `--all` flag to process all delegates, or specify individual delegates with `--delegate <name>`

## Usage

### Running Manually

Navigate to the core directory and run the scripts:

```bash
cd core
```

For TBW calculations:
```bash
# Calculate rewards for all delegates
python tbw.py --all

# Calculate rewards for a specific delegate
python tbw.py --delegate <delegate_name>
```

For payments:
```bash
# Process payments for all delegates
python pay.py --all

# Process payments for a specific delegate
python pay.py --delegate <delegate_name>
```

### Running with PM2

For continuous operation, use pm2:

```bash
pm2 start apps.json
```

## Configuration

After cloning the repository, create and modify the configuration file at `core/config/delegates.json`. The file uses a JSON structure with an array of delegate configurations.

### Configuration Structure

The `delegates.json` file contains an array of delegate objects, each with the following structure:

```json
{
    "delegates": [
        {
            "name": "delegate1",
            "static": {
                "atomic": 100000000,
                "network": "ark_devnet",
                "start_block": 0
            },
            "delegate": {
                "message": "Thank you for voting delegate1",
                "voter_share": 90,
                "voter_cap": 0,
                "voter_min": 0,
                "whitelist": false,
                "whitelist_address": [],
                "blacklist": false,
                "blacklist_address": []
            },
            "payment": {
                "interval": 211,
                "multi": true,
                "passphrase": "passphrase1",
                "secondphrase": null,
                "delegate_fee": [10],
                "delegate_fee_address": ["addr1"]
            },
            "exchange": {
                "exchange": false,
                "convert_from": ["ark", "ark"],
                "convert_address": ["addr1", "addr2"],
                "convert_to": ["usdc", "xrp"],
                "address_to": ["usdc_addr1", "xrp_addr2"],
                "network_to": ["eth", "xrp"],
                "provider": ["provider", "provider"]
            },
            "other": {
                "custom": false,
                "manual_pay": false,
                "update_share": false
            },
            "donate": {
                "donate": false,
                "donate_address": "addr1",
                "donate_percent": 0
            }
        },
        // Additional delegate configurations follow the same structure
    ]
}
```

## Logging

Logs are stored in the `logs` directory with filenames based on delegate names. Each delegate has its own log file for easy tracking and troubleshooting.

## LXC Server Optimization

When running multiple delegates on a single LXC server, consider:

- Allocating sufficient resources to the LXC container
- Monitoring database performance
- Setting appropriate payment intervals to distribute server load
- Using pm2 for process management and automatic restarts
